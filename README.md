# üåü Tutorial: Setting Up Your Own LLM Server

## Introduction
This tutorial guides you through the process of turning a GPU-equipped laptop or desktop into a server that hosts a Large Language Model (LLM) like Llama7b, both locally and on AWS. This step-by-step guide is designed for first-time users and explains the advantages of local and cloud setups.

## Why Set Up a Local LLM?
- **Privacy and Security**: Your data stays within your local network or private cloud environment.
- **Performance Improvements**: Direct access to hardware resources reduces latency.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Optimize expenses with cloud resources when needed.
- **Customization and Control**: Fully manage your model's environment and updates.

## What You'll Need
- **A Computer with a GPU**: Preferably NVIDIA CUDA-compatible for local setup.
- **Operating System**: Windows, Linux, or macOS.
- **Software**: Docker, Python.
- **AWS Account**: For deploying on AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

## üõ† Step 1: Install Docker
Install and configure Docker to containerize the LLM application.

### For Windows and macOS:
- Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

### For Linux:
- Use your package manager to install Docker:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
  sudo groupadd docker
  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
  newgrp docker
  ```

## üêç Step 2: Install Python
Download and install Python to run the Flask application:
- [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## üéÆ Step 3: Prepare Your Windows for LLM
Ensure your Windows system is ready with the necessary drivers and subsystems.

### Install NVIDIA GPU Drivers:
- Identify and install the correct drivers from [NVIDIA's Driver Downloads](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx).

### Setup Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):
- Enable WSL and Virtual Machine Platform via PowerShell and system settings, then restart your computer.

## üì¶ Step 4: Pull Your LLM Model
Retrieve your LLM model using Docker:
```bash
docker pull huggingface/transformers-pytorch-gpu
```

## üöÄ Step 5: Set Up Your Flask Server
Develop a Flask server to facilitate model interaction:
1. **Create and navigate to your project directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir llama7b_project
   cd llama7b_project
   ```
2. **Implement the Flask app** (`app.py`):
   ```python
   from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
   import torch
   from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

   app = Flask(__name__)

   tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B")
   model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B")

   @app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
   def chat():
       text = request.json['text']
       inputs = tokenizer.encode(text, return_tensors='pt')
       response = model.generate(inputs, max_length=50)
       reply = tokenizer.decode(response[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
       return jsonify({'reply': reply})

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
   ```

## üõ† Step 6: Deploy on AWS VPC
Deploy your server within an AWS VPC for enhanced security and scalability.

1. **Create an EC2 Instance**:
   - Choose an instance type with GPU capabilities, such as the `p2` or `p3` series.
   - Launch the instance within your VPC, ensuring that your security group allows traffic on port 5000.

2. **Set Up Your Environment**:
   - Install Docker and Python on the EC2 instance.
   - Transfer your Flask application using SCP or a similar tool.

3. **Run the Docker Container**:
   - Use the same Docker commands to run your containerized LLM model on the EC2 instance.

4. **Adjust Security Settings**:
   - Modify your VPC's security group to ensure the Flask application is accessible on port 5000 from your desired IP ranges.

## üåê Step 7: Access the Model Through a Browser
Connect to your model via a web interface accessible through your VPC:
- Use the EC2 instance's public IP or linked domain to navigate: `http://<EC2
